Feature-based Customer Review Mining- An Implementation Solution Prototype
==============================

This project, summarises and explains the approach elaborated in [Kushal Bafna & Durga Toshniwal, 2013]. Its purpose is to serve as a prototype for an internal company project I am working on.

In general, the problem I intend to address is that of allowing for customers to extract objective review summaries relevant to a particular product, without having to go through the trouble of reading the whole set of available reviews.

The following sections, will cover the distinct steps that need to be followed. These concern:
a) the identification of features of a product from customers' opinions,
b) the extraction of opinions and the detection of their orientation or polarity relevant to each feature,
c) the calculation of the final polarity of feature-opinions pairs, and
d) the generation of feature based summarizations of the reviews, by through the extraction of the relevant excerpts with respect to each feature-opinions pair, and their placing into their respective feature based cluster.

The assumption is that these feature-based excerpts can easily be digested by the user.
